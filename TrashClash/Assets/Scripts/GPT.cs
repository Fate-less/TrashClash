Integrating with Unity
Card Representation: Use Unity's GameObjects to visually represent cards. You can attach the Card script to these objects or manage them through a card manager.
UI Elements: For deck management and gameplay, you'll use Unity's UI system to create menus, buttons, and display card information.
Game Logic: The GameController script will interact with Unity's event system to control the flow of the game, responding to player inputs and triggering game events.

Next Steps
Expand Card Abilities: Look into more complex systems for implementing card abilities, such as using a scripting language like Lua or creating a more sophisticated ability system in C#.
Networking: For multiplayer, delve into Unity's networking capabilities to sync game states between players.
Optimization and Polishing: As your game becomes more complex, consider performance optimizations and how to polish the user experience with animations, sound effects, and visual feedback.
This outline and examples should give you a starting point for developing a TCG in Unity. Each game is unique, so feel free to adjust and expand upon these basics to suit your game's needs.
